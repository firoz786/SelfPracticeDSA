# SelfPracticeDSA
Perfect — that’s the right mindset ✅.
When preparing Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) for product-based companies (like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc.), you should focus on patterns, not just random problems.
Patterns help you solve hundreds of questions by recognizing repetition in logic.

Below is a complete roadmap with 18 key patterns — for each, I’ve given:
1️⃣ The pattern name
2️⃣ The concept behind it
3️⃣ The must-solve question list (with increasing difficulty)
